# Using the Nitrous Command Line

In this unit, you'll be learning to use the command line and BASH. This is the lowest-level and most powerful way that developers interact with their computers. You'll notice that the majority of the readmes and videos use the native OSX terminal app to interact with the command line. If you're using nitrous, however, you have nothing to worry about.

Your nitrous container is a 'virtual machine' - that is, a computer that is running in the cloud. When you open up your nitrous environment, your command line is in the pane at the bottom of the screen. As you move through the following lessons, use the nitrous command line as a replacement for the terminal that is used in the lessons presented here.

Happy BASHing!
